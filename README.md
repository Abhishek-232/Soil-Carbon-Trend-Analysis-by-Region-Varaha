# Soil-Carbon-trend-analysis-varaha
The goal of this project is to analyze soil carbon data from 5 Indian regions (2023–2024) to identify where regenerative practices had the most impact. Used Python to explore trends by region, season, crop, and method. Applied statistical tests to validate changes, supporting Varaha’s MRV process and carbon credit strategy.
