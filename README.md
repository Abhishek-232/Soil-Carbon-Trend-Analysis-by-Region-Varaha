# Soil Carbon Trend Analysis by Region
The goal of this project is to analyze soil carbon data from 5 Indian regions (2023â€“2024) to identify where regenerative practices had the most impact. Used Python to explore trends by region, season, crop, and method. Applied statistical tests to validate changes, supporting Varahaâ€™s MRV process and carbon credit strategy.

## Objective

To determine where regenerative farming practices have shown the most improvement in soil carbon content, and to generate actionable insights for Varaha ClimateAg's MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) process.

---

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains:
- Soil carbon percentages at different depths (15cm, 30cm, 45cm)
- Farm IDs, crop types, districts, and regions
- Measurement methods (manual vs remote vs mixed)
- Sampling season and date (Rabi/Kharif 2023â€“2024)
- Field notes and conditions

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy, Statsmodels
---

## ðŸ“Š Key Analyses Performed

- Regional trends in soil carbon % over time
- Seasonal comparison: Rabi 2023 vs Kharif 2024
- Crop-type impact on soil health
- Depth-wise consistency of soil carbon levels
- Statistical testing:
  - Independent t-tests (e.g., manual vs remote)
  - Linear regression (year-wise trend modeling)
  - Correlation analysis (depth vs carbon %)
- Outlier detection and quality check via remarks field

---

## Business Questions Answered

- Which regions show the highest average soil carbon % and which show the lowest?
- How has soil carbon changed over time in each region (Rabi 2023 to Kharif 2024)?
- Which crop types are associated with the greatest improvements in soil carbon %?
- How consistent are measurements at different soil depths (15 cm vs. 30 cm vs. 45 cm)?
- Are there outlier farms with unusually low soil carbon levels? What conditions were noted in remarks?
- Which districts saw the most improvement from Rabi 2023 to Rabi 2024?
- How do smallholder carbon trends differ by crop type and method?
- What percentage of the total farms sampled are meeting the ideal carbon threshold (e.g., >0.6%)?

---

## Sample Insights

- Punjab and Madhya Pradesh showed the most consistent gains in soil carbon %.
- Wheat and rice crops were associated with higher soil health improvements.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Outcome

This project enables data-driven targeting for regenerative agriculture programs and supports Varahaâ€™s climate reporting with validated insights. The methodology is scalable and can be extended to integrate geospatial or yield data for deeper impact forecasting.
